# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

The project that I started this CI for [shappimage](https://github.com/mgord9518/shappimage) has moved on
to using my [squashfuse-zig](https://github.com/mgord9518/squashfuse-zig) tools and the crappy build
scripts I've been using here constantly break and I don't have the motivation to maintain them anymore so
I will be archiving this repo.

If you need portable builds of squashfuse tools I'd recommend trying that repo, they should be fully
compatable with the originals (with comparable performance). Otherwise, it should be fairly easy to build
squashfuse from source using some code from the build scripts here.
